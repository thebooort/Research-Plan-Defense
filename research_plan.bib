Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.},

For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also dis- cuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.},

Next Generation Sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have brought a revolution to the bioinformatics landscape, by offering sheer amounts of data about previously unaccessible domains in a cheap and scalable way. However, fast, reproducible, and cost-effective data analysis at such scale remains elusive. A key need for achieving it is being able to access and query the vast amount of publicly available data, specially so in the case of knowledge-intensive, semantically rich data: incredibly valuable information about proteins and their functions, genes, pathways, or all sort of biological knowledge encoded in ontologies remains scattered, semantically and physically fragmented. Methods and Results. Guided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph models. We have modeled and integrated most publicly available data linked with proteins into a set of interdependent graphs. Data querying is possible through a data model aware Domain Specific Language implemented in Java, letting the user write typed graph traversals over the integrated data. A ready to use cloud-based data distribution, based on the Titan graph database engine is provided; generic data import code can also be used for in-house deployment. Conclusion. Bio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for several key problems: data integration; expressive, high performance data access; and a cost-effective scalable cloud deployment model.},

	abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these “brain hubs” is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called “rich club,” characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form “small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

The parallel algorithm developed is general in the sense that there is no restriction imposed on the size of the problem and that it is independent of the dimension of the hypercube. The comparison of this algorithm with the parallel algorithms based on the LU factorization show that the execution time is divided by a factor of two, approximately},

	abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the ?strengths? of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.},

A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets). In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.},

At the highest level, users may specify and run distributed EAs simply by manipulating graphical displays.

XSLT is a general purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML document). Previously, a solution that solved the problem efficiently was proposed. In this paper, we improve on those results by testing different fitness functions, adding a new operator and changing the type of desired output document that can be obtained. The experiments show that the best results are obtained without considering the XSLT length and including this new operator.},

	abstract = {Mating disruption is an agricultural technique that intends to substitute the use of insecticides for pest control. This technique consists of the diffusion of large amounts of sexual pheromone, so that the males are confused and mating is disrupted. Pheromones are released using devices called dispensers. The speed of release is, generally, a function of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. One of the objectives in the design of the dispensers is to minimise the effect of atmospheric conditions in the performance of the dispenser. With this objective, the Centro de Ecologia Quimica Agricola (CEQA) has designed an experimental dispenser that aims to compete with the dispensers already in the market. The hypothesis we want to validate (and which is based on experimental results) is that the performance of the CEQA dispenser is independent of the atmospheric conditions, as opposed to the most widely used commercial dispenser, Isomate CPlus. This was done using a genetic programming (GP) algorithm. GP evolved functions able to describe the performance of both dispensers and that support the initial hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for modeling the arrival dates in time-stamped data sequences such as newscasts, e-mails, IRC conversations, scientific journal articles or weblog postings. These models are applied to the detection of buzz (i.e. terms that occur with a higher-than-normal frequency) in them, which has attracted a lot of interest in the online world with the increasing number of periodic content producers. That is why in this paper we have used this kind of online sequences to test our system, though it is also valid for other types of event sequences. The algorithm assigns frequencies (number of events per time unit) to time intervals so that it produces an optimal fit to the data. The optimization procedure is a trade off between accurately fitting the data and avoiding too many frequency changes, thus overcoming the noise inherent in these sequences. This process has been traditionally performed using dynamic programming algorithms, which are limited by memory and efficiency requirements. This limitation can be a problem when dealing with long sequences, and suggests the application of alternative search methods with some degree of uncertainty to achieve tractability, such as the evolutionary algorithm proposed in this paper. This algorithm is able to reach the same solution quality as those classical dynamic programming algorithms, but in a shorter time. We also test different cost functions and propose a new one that yields better fits than the one originally proposed by Kleinberg on real-world data. Finally, several distributions of states for the finite state automata are tested, with the result that an uniform distribution produces much better fits than the geometric distribution also proposed by Kleinberg. We also present a variant of the evolutionary algorithm, which achieves a fast fit of a sequence extended with new data, by taking advantage of the fit obtained for the original subsequence.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are readily available bioinformatics methods for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data, provided that such biological information is previously transformed to fixed-size, metric-based vectors. To increase the usefulness of SOM-based approaches for the analysis of genomic sequence data, novel representation methods are required that automatically and bijectively transform aligned nucleotide sequences into numeric vectors, dealing with both nucleotide ambiguity and gaps derived from sequence alignment.Results: Six different codification variants based on Euclidean space, just like SOM processing, have been tested using two SOM models: the classical Kohonen’s SOM and growing cell structures. They have been applied to two different sets of sequences: 32 sequences of small sub-unit ribosomal RNA from organisms belonging to the three domains of life, and 44 sequences of the reverse transcriptase region of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 belonging to different groups and sub-types. Our results show that the most important factor affecting the accuracy of sequence clustering is the assignment of an extra weight to the presence of alignment-derived gaps. Although each of the codification variants shows a different level of taxonomic consistency, the results are in agreement with sequence-based phylogenetic reconstructions and anticipate a broad applicability of this codification method.Contact: sole@eui.upm.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.},

	abstract = {Purpose – It is common for an international company to have different brands, products or services, information for investors, a corporate blog, affiliates, branches in different countries, etc. If all these contents appear as independent additional web domains (AWDs), the company should be represented on the web by all these web domains, since many of these AWDs may acquire remarkable performance that could mask or distort the real web performance of the company, affecting therefore on the understanding of web metrics. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach – The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings – The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications – The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value – Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.},

Second, the system can suggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe becomes more authentic for any selected regional cuisine style.

However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72\%, along with an accuracy of 94.47\% on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson’s disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55\%, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson’s disease patients.},

The system can recognize food and estimate the calorific and nutrition content of foods automatically without any user intervention. To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate. Previous approaches have mostly worked with either images captured in a lab setting, or they require additional user input (eg, user crop bounding boxes). Our system achieves automatic food detection and recognition in real-life settings containing cluttered backgrounds. When multiple food items appear in an image, our system can identify them and estimate their portion size simultaneously. We implemented this system as both an Android smartphone application and as a web service. In our experiments, we have achieved above 85\% accuracy when detecting 15 different kinds of foods.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents “rate-limited” information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages.
A consideration of network parts reveals several widespread motifs in the structure of diverse networks across several disciplines.

Whereas the introduction of network theory has enabled ecologists to quantify not only the degree, but also the architecture of ecological complexity, these advances have come at the cost of introducing new challenges, including new theoretical concepts and metrics, and increased data complexity and computational intensity. Synthesizing recent developments in the network ecology literature, we point to several potential solutions to these issues: integrating network metrics and their terminology across sub-disciplines; benchmarking new network algorithms and models to increase mechanistic understanding; and improving tools for sharing ecological network research, in particular ?model? data provenance, to increase the reproducibility of network models and analyses. We propose that applying these solutions will aid in synthesizing ecological sub-disciplines and allied fields by improving the accessibility of network methods and models.},

	abstract = {Plant-pollinator networks have been widely used to understand the ecology of mutualistic interactions between plants and animals. While a number of general patterns have been identified, the mechanisms underlying the structure of plant-pollinator networks are poorly understood. Here we present an agent based model (ABM) that simulates the movement of bees over heterogeneous landscapes and captures pollination events, enabling the influence of landscape pattern on pollination networks to be explored. Using the model, we conducted a series of experiments using virtual landscapes representing a gradient of forest loss and fragmentation. The ABM was able to produce expected trends in network structure, from simulations of interactions between individual plants and pollinators. For example, results indicated an increase in the index of complementary specialization (H2’) and a decline in network connectance with increasing forest cover. Furthermore, network nestedness was not associated with the degree of forest cover, but was positively related to forest patch size, further supporting results obtained in the field. This illustrates the potential value of ABMs for exploring the structure and dynamics of plant-pollinator networks, and for understanding the mechanisms that underlie them. We attribute the results obtained primarily to a shift from specialist to generalist pollinators with increasing forest loss, a trend that has been observed in some field situations.},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of pollination service delivery require a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between plants and flower visitors. To improve measurements of pollinator performance underlying such predictions, we surveyed visitation frequency, pollinator effectiveness (pollen deposition ability) and pollinator importance (the product of visitation frequency and effectiveness) of flower visitors in a diverse Mediterranean flower meadow. With these data we constructed the largest pollinator importance network to date and compared it with the corresponding visitation network to estimate the specialisation of the community with greater precision. Visitation frequencies at the community level were positively correlated with the amount of pollen deposited during individual visits, though rarely correlated at lower taxonomic resolution. Bees had the highest levels of pollinator effectiveness, with Apis, Andrena, Lasioglossum and Osmiini bees being the most effective visitors to a number of plant species. Bomblyiid flies were the most effective non-bee flower visitors. Predictions of community specialisation (H2′) were higher in the pollinator importance network than the visitation network, mirroring previous studies. Our results increase confidence in existing measures of pollinator redundancy at the community level using visitation data, while also providing detailed information on interaction quality at the plant species level.},

Both the shape of the pollination kernel and the spatial distribution of trees affect the distribution of pollen grains and the genotypes they harbour, but little is known about the relative contribution of each of these two factors. Using genetic markers we build a spatial network of pollination events between any two trees in a population of Prunus mahaleb, an insect-pollinated plant. Then, we apply tools from the science of complex networks to characterize the structure of such a mating network. Although the distribution of the number of pollen donors per tree is quite homogeneous, the identity of donors is distributed heterogeneously across the population. This results in a population structured in well-defined modules or compartments, formed by a group of mother trees and their shared pollen donors. Long-distance pollination events decrease the modular structure by favouring mating among all available mates. This increases gene flow across the entire population, reducing its genetic structure, and potentially decreasing the role of genetic drift.},

Output from these generative models is then the basis for designing and evaluating computational methods on networks including verification and simulation studies. During the last two decades, a variety of models has been proposed with an ultimate goal of achieving comprehensive realism for the generated networks. In this study, we (a) introduce a new generator, termed ReCoN; (b) explore how ReCoN and some existing models can be fitted to an original network to produce a structurally similar replica, (c) use ReCoN to produce networks much larger than the original exemplar, and finally (d) discuss open problems and promising research directions. In a comparative experimental study, we find that ReCoN is often superior to many other state-of-the-art network generation methods. We argue that ReCoN is a scalable and effective tool for modeling a given network while preserving important properties at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and for scaling the exemplar data by orders of magnitude in size.},

We review the most well known algorithms for constructing networks with given non-homogeneous statistical properties and provide simple pseudo-code for reproducing such networks in software simulations. We also review some useful mathematical results and approximations associated with the statistics that describe these network models, including degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient. We demonstrate how such results can be used as partial verification and validation of implementations. Finally, we discuss a sometimes overlooked modeling choice that can be crucially important for the properties of simulated networks: that of network directedness.The most well known network algorithms produce undirected networks, and we emphasize this point by highlighting how simple adaptations can instead produce directed networks.},

However, the evolutionary processes that gave rise to these associations remain poorly understood. We reconstructed the times of divergence, diversification patterns, and interaction networks of a diverse group of specialized orchids and their bee pollinators. In contrast to a scenario of coevolution by race formation, we show that fragrance-producing orchids originated at least three times independently after their fragrance-collecting bee mutualists. Whereas orchid diversification has apparently tracked the diversification of orchids' bee pollinators, bees appear to have depended on the diverse chemical environment of neotropical forests. We corroborated this apparent asymmetrical dependency by simulating co-extinction cascades in real interaction networks that lacked reciprocal specialization. These results suggest that the diversification of insect-pollinated angiosperms may have been facilitated by the exploitation of preexisting sensory biases of insect pollinators.},

	abstract = {Pollinator-mediated evolutionary divergence has seldom been explored in generalist clades because it is assumed that pollinators in those clades exert weak and conflicting selection. We investigate whether pollinators shape floral diversification in a pollination generalist plant genus, Erysimum. Species from this genus have flowers that appeal to broad assemblages of pollinators. Nevertheless, we recently reported that it is possible to sort plant species into pollination niches varying in the quantitative composition of pollinators. We test here whether floral characters of Erysimum have evolved as a consequence of shifts among pollination niches. For this, we quantified the evolutionary lability of the floral traits and their phylogenetic association with pollination niches. As with pollination niches, Erysimum floral traits show weak phylogenetic signal. Moreover, floral shape and color are phylogenetically associated with pollination niche. In particular, plants belonging to a pollination niche dominated by long-tongued large bees have lilac corollas with parallel petals. Further analyses suggest, however, that changes in color preceded changes in pollination niche. Pollinators seem to have driven the evolution of corolla shape, whereas the association between pollination niche and corolla color has probably arisen by lilac-flowered Erysimum moving toward certain pollination niches for other adaptive reasons.},

Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such “modularly varying goals” lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.},

	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree \$k\$ follows a power law, decaying like \$k{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, often with \$2 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha {\textless} 3\$. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.},

We examined this issue using digital organisms—computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Populations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. Complex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. However, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. The first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. In some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. These findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection.},

The essence of the similarity here is that network features of the same network type are highly similar, while the features of different kinds of networks present low similarity. In this paper, we introduce and explore a new method for comparing various complex networks based on the cut distance. We show correspondence between the cut distance and the similarity of two networks. This correspondence allows us to consider a broad range of complex networks and explicitly compare various networks with high accuracy. Various machine learning technologies such as genetic algorithms, nearest neighbor classification, and model selection are employed during the comparison process. Our cut method is shown to be suited for comparisons of undirected networks and directed networks, as well as weighted networks. In the model selection process, the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with respect to accuracy.},

	abstract = {Recent works on representation learning for graph structured data predominantly focus on learning distributed representations of graph substructures such as nodes and subgraphs. However, many graph analytics tasks such as graph classification and clustering require representing entire graphs as fixed length feature vectors. While the aforementioned approaches are naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the most effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph kernels use handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence, they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification, clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that graph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.},

	abstract = {Finding the correct encoding for a generic dynamical system's trajectory is a complicated task: the symbolic sequence needs to preserve the invariant properties from the system's trajectory. In theory, the solution to this problem is found when a Generating Markov Partition (GMP) is obtained, which is only defined once the unstable and stable manifolds are known with infinite precision and for all times. However, these manifolds usually form highly convoluted Euclidean sets, are a priori unknown, and, as it happens in any real-world experiment, measurements are made with finite resolution and over a finite time-span. The task gets even more complicated if the system is a network composed of interacting dynamical units, namely, a high-dimensional complex system. Here, we tackle this task and solve it by defining a method to approximately construct GMPs for any complex system's finite-resolution and finite-time trajectory. We critically test our method on networks of coupled maps, encoding their trajectories into symbolic sequences. We show that these sequences are optimal because they minimise the information loss and also any spurious information added. Consequently, our method allows us to approximately calculate the invariant probability measures of complex systems from the observed data. Thus, we can efficiently define complexity measures that are applicable to a wide range of complex phenomena, such as the characterisation of brain activity from electroencephalogram signals measured at different brain regions or the characterisation of climate variability from temperature anomalies measured at different Earth regions.},

Stochastic generative models inspired different scenarios to explain the growth of interaction networks during evolution. The power law and the associated properties appeared so ubiquitous in complex networks that they were qualified as “universal laws”. However, these properties are no longer observed when the data are subjected to statistical tests: in most cases, the data do not fit the expected theoretical models, and the cases of good fitting merely result from sampling artefacts or improper data representation. The field of network biology seems to be founded on a series of myths, i.e. widely believed but false ideas. The weaknesses of these foundations should however not be considered as a failure for the entire domain. Network analysis provides a powerful frame for understanding the function and evolution of biological processes, provided it is brought to an appropriate level of description, by focussing on smaller functional modules and establishing the link between their topological properties and their dynamical behaviour.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603229},
	abstract = {How do real graphs evolve over time? What are ``normal'' growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest fire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study. We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.},

	abstract = {Deepening our understanding of the characteristics and behaviors of population-based search algorithms remains an important ongoing challenge in Evolutionary Computation. To date however, most studies of Evolutionary Algorithms have only been able to take place within tightly restricted experimental conditions. For instance, many analytical methods can only be applied to canonical algorithmic forms or can only evaluate evolution over simple test functions. Analysis of EA behavior under more complex conditions is needed to broaden our understanding of this population-based search process. This paper presents an approach to analyzing EA behavior that can be applied to a diverse range of algorithm designs and environmental conditions. The approach is based on evaluating an individual’s impact on population dynamics using metrics derived from genealogical graphs. From experiments conducted over a broad range of conditions, some important conclusions are drawn in this study. First, it is determined that very few individuals in an EA population have a significant influence on future population dynamics with the impact size fitting a power law distribution. The power law distribution indicates there is a non-negligible probability that single individuals will dominate the entire population, irrespective of population size. Two EA design features are however found to cause strong changes to this aspect of EA behavior: (1) the population topology and (2) the introduction of completely new individuals. If the EA population topology has a long path length or if new (i.e. historically uncoupled) individuals are continually inserted into the population, then power law deviations are observed for large impact sizes. It is concluded that such EA designs can not be dominated by a small number of individuals and hence should theoretically be capable of exhibiting higher degrees of parallel search behavior.},

	abstract = {Tabular data are pervasive. Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also dis- cuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.},

	abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these “brain hubs” is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called “rich club,” characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form “small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

This method is based in the WZ decomposition of the system's matrix. The parallel algorithm developed is general in the sense that there is no restriction imposed on the size of the problem and that it is independent of the dimension of the hypercube. The comparison of this algorithm with the parallel algorithms based on the LU factorization show that the execution time is divided by a factor of two, approximately},

	abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the ?strengths? of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.},

A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets). In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.},

XSLT is a general purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML document). Previously, a solution that solved the problem efficiently was proposed. In this paper, we improve on those results by testing different fitness functions, adding a new operator and changing the type of desired output document that can be obtained. The experiments show that the best results are obtained without considering the XSLT length and including this new operator.},

	abstract = {Mating disruption is an agricultural technique that intends to substitute the use of insecticides for pest control. This technique consists of the diffusion of large amounts of sexual pheromone, so that the males are confused and mating is disrupted. Pheromones are released using devices called dispensers. The speed of release is, generally, a function of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. One of the objectives in the design of the dispensers is to minimise the effect of atmospheric conditions in the performance of the dispenser. With this objective, the Centro de Ecologia Quimica Agricola (CEQA) has designed an experimental dispenser that aims to compete with the dispensers already in the market. The hypothesis we want to validate (and which is based on experimental results) is that the performance of the CEQA dispenser is independent of the atmospheric conditions, as opposed to the most widely used commercial dispenser, Isomate CPlus. This was done using a genetic programming (GP) algorithm. GP evolved functions able to describe the performance of both dispensers and that support the initial hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.},

	abstract = {Purpose – It is common for an international company to have different brands, products or services, information for investors, a corporate blog, affiliates, branches in different countries, etc. If all these contents appear as independent additional web domains (AWDs), the company should be represented on the web by all these web domains, since many of these AWDs may acquire remarkable performance that could mask or distort the real web performance of the company, affecting therefore on the understanding of web metrics. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach – The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings – The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications – The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value – Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.},

However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72\%, along with an accuracy of 94.47\% on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson’s disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55\%, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson’s disease patients.},

The system can recognize food and estimate the calorific and nutrition content of foods automatically without any user intervention. To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate. Previous approaches have mostly worked with either images captured in a lab setting, or they require additional user input (eg, user crop bounding boxes). Our system achieves automatic food detection and recognition in real-life settings containing cluttered backgrounds. When multiple food items appear in an image, our system can identify them and estimate their portion size simultaneously. We implemented this system as both an Android smartphone application and as a web service. In our experiments, we have achieved above 85\% accuracy when detecting 15 different kinds of foods.},

	abstract = {Background Inferring a gene regulatory network from time-series gene expression data in systems biology is a challenging problem. Many methods have been suggested, most of which have a scalability limitation due to the combinatorial cost of searching a regulatory set of genes. In addition, they have focused on the accurate inference of a network structure only. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a network inference method to search regulatory genes efficiently and to predict the network dynamics accurately. Results In this study, we employed a Boolean network model with a restricted update rule scheme to capture coarse-grained dynamics, and propose a novel mutual information-based Boolean network inference (MIBNI) method. Given time-series gene expression data as an input, the method first identifies a set of initial regulatory genes using mutual information-based feature selection, and then improves the dynamics prediction accuracy by iteratively swapping a pair of genes between sets of the selected regulatory genes and the other genes. Through extensive simulations with artificial datasets, MIBNI showed consistently better performance than six well-known existing methods, REVEAL, Best-Fit, RelNet, CST, CLR, and BIBN in terms of both structural and dynamics prediction accuracy. We further tested the proposed method with two real gene expression datasets for an Escherichia coli gene regulatory network and a fission yeast cell cycle network, and also observed better results using MIBNI compared to the six other methods. Conclusions Taken together, MIBNI is a promising tool for predicting both the structure and the dynamics of a gene regulatory network.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Each resolution level is analyzed with a focus of attention resulting from a coarser resolution level analysis. At each resolution level, a spatial refinement by semi-supervised clustering is performed to obtain more accurate segmentation around edges. The proposed segmentation is fully unsupervised by using domain specific knowledge.},

	abstract = {Complex real-world networks commonly reveal characteristic groups of nodes like communities and modules. These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also dis- cuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.},

	abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these “brain hubs” is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called “rich club,” characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

	abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the ?strengths? of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.},

A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets). In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new version of an evolutionary algorithm that creates XSLT programs from its intended input and output. XSLT is a general purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML document). Previously, a solution that solved the problem efficiently was proposed. In this paper, we improve on those results by testing different fitness functions, adding a new operator and changing the type of desired output document that can be obtained. The experiments show that the best results are obtained without considering the XSLT length and including this new operator.},

	abstract = {Mating disruption is an agricultural technique that intends to substitute the use of insecticides for pest control. This technique consists of the diffusion of large amounts of sexual pheromone, so that the males are confused and mating is disrupted. Pheromones are released using devices called dispensers. The speed of release is, generally, a function of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. One of the objectives in the design of the dispensers is to minimise the effect of atmospheric conditions in the performance of the dispenser. With this objective, the Centro de Ecologia Quimica Agricola (CEQA) has designed an experimental dispenser that aims to compete with the dispensers already in the market. The hypothesis we want to validate (and which is based on experimental results) is that the performance of the CEQA dispenser is independent of the atmospheric conditions, as opposed to the most widely used commercial dispenser, Isomate CPlus. This was done using a genetic programming (GP) algorithm. GP evolved functions able to describe the performance of both dispensers and that support the initial hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.},

	abstract = {Purpose – It is common for an international company to have different brands, products or services, information for investors, a corporate blog, affiliates, branches in different countries, etc. If all these contents appear as independent additional web domains (AWDs), the company should be represented on the web by all these web domains, since many of these AWDs may acquire remarkable performance that could mask or distort the real web performance of the company, affecting therefore on the understanding of web metrics. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach – The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings – The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications – The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value – Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.},

However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72\%, along with an accuracy of 94.47\% on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson’s disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55\%, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson’s disease patients.},

The system can recognize food and estimate the calorific and nutrition content of foods automatically without any user intervention. To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate. Previous approaches have mostly worked with either images captured in a lab setting, or they require additional user input (eg, user crop bounding boxes). Our system achieves automatic food detection and recognition in real-life settings containing cluttered backgrounds. When multiple food items appear in an image, our system can identify them and estimate their portion size simultaneously. We implemented this system as both an Android smartphone application and as a web service. In our experiments, we have achieved above 85\% accuracy when detecting 15 different kinds of foods.},

Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also dis- cuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.},

Next Generation Sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have brought a revolution to the bioinformatics landscape, by offering sheer amounts of data about previously unaccessible domains in a cheap and scalable way. However, fast, reproducible, and cost-effective data analysis at such scale remains elusive. A key need for achieving it is being able to access and query the vast amount of publicly available data, specially so in the case of knowledge-intensive, semantically rich data: incredibly valuable information about proteins and their functions, genes, pathways, or all sort of biological knowledge encoded in ontologies remains scattered, semantically and physically fragmented. Methods and Results. Guided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph models. We have modeled and integrated most publicly available data linked with proteins into a set of interdependent graphs. Data querying is possible through a data model aware Domain Specific Language implemented in Java, letting the user write typed graph traversals over the integrated data. A ready to use cloud-based data distribution, based on the Titan graph database engine is provided; generic data import code can also be used for in-house deployment. Conclusion. Bio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for several key problems: data integration; expressive, high performance data access; and a cost-effective scalable cloud deployment model.},

	abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders.},

Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these “brain hubs” is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called “rich club,” characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form “small worlds,” in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

The parallel algorithm developed is general in the sense that there is no restriction imposed on the size of the problem and that it is independent of the dimension of the hypercube. The comparison of this algorithm with the parallel algorithms based on the LU factorization show that the execution time is divided by a factor of two, approximately},

	abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the ?strengths? of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.},

A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets). In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.},

At the highest level, users may specify and run distributed EAs simply by manipulating graphical displays.

XSLT is a general purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML document). Previously, a solution that solved the problem efficiently was proposed. In this paper, we improve on those results by testing different fitness functions, adding a new operator and changing the type of desired output document that can be obtained. The experiments show that the best results are obtained without considering the XSLT length and including this new operator.},

	abstract = {Mating disruption is an agricultural technique that intends to substitute the use of insecticides for pest control. This technique consists of the diffusion of large amounts of sexual pheromone, so that the males are confused and mating is disrupted. Pheromones are released using devices called dispensers. The speed of release is, generally, a function of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. One of the objectives in the design of the dispensers is to minimise the effect of atmospheric conditions in the performance of the dispenser. With this objective, the Centro de Ecologia Quimica Agricola (CEQA) has designed an experimental dispenser that aims to compete with the dispensers already in the market. The hypothesis we want to validate (and which is based on experimental results) is that the performance of the CEQA dispenser is independent of the atmospheric conditions, as opposed to the most widely used commercial dispenser, Isomate CPlus. This was done using a genetic programming (GP) algorithm. GP evolved functions able to describe the performance of both dispensers and that support the initial hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for modeling the arrival dates in time-stamped data sequences such as newscasts, e-mails, IRC conversations, scientific journal articles or weblog postings. These models are applied to the detection of buzz (i.e. terms that occur with a higher-than-normal frequency) in them, which has attracted a lot of interest in the online world with the increasing number of periodic content producers. That is why in this paper we have used this kind of online sequences to test our system, though it is also valid for other types of event sequences. The algorithm assigns frequencies (number of events per time unit) to time intervals so that it produces an optimal fit to the data. The optimization procedure is a trade off between accurately fitting the data and avoiding too many frequency changes, thus overcoming the noise inherent in these sequences. This process has been traditionally performed using dynamic programming algorithms, which are limited by memory and efficiency requirements. This limitation can be a problem when dealing with long sequences, and suggests the application of alternative search methods with some degree of uncertainty to achieve tractability, such as the evolutionary algorithm proposed in this paper. This algorithm is able to reach the same solution quality as those classical dynamic programming algorithms, but in a shorter time. We also test different cost functions and propose a new one that yields better fits than the one originally proposed by Kleinberg on real-world data. Finally, several distributions of states for the finite state automata are tested, with the result that an uniform distribution produces much better fits than the geometric distribution also proposed by Kleinberg. We also present a variant of the evolutionary algorithm, which achieves a fast fit of a sequence extended with new data, by taking advantage of the fit obtained for the original subsequence.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are readily available bioinformatics methods for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data, provided that such biological information is previously transformed to fixed-size, metric-based vectors. To increase the usefulness of SOM-based approaches for the analysis of genomic sequence data, novel representation methods are required that automatically and bijectively transform aligned nucleotide sequences into numeric vectors, dealing with both nucleotide ambiguity and gaps derived from sequence alignment.Results: Six different codification variants based on Euclidean space, just like SOM processing, have been tested using two SOM models: the classical Kohonen’s SOM and growing cell structures. They have been applied to two different sets of sequences: 32 sequences of small sub-unit ribosomal RNA from organisms belonging to the three domains of life, and 44 sequences of the reverse transcriptase region of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 belonging to different groups and sub-types. Our results show that the most important factor affecting the accuracy of sequence clustering is the assignment of an extra weight to the presence of alignment-derived gaps. Although each of the codification variants shows a different level of taxonomic consistency, the results are in agreement with sequence-based phylogenetic reconstructions and anticipate a broad applicability of this codification method.Contact: sole@eui.upm.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {This work presents an evolutionary approach to optimize the parameters of a Fuzzy-based autonomous driver for the open simulated car racing game (TORCS). Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.},

	abstract = {Purpose – It is common for an international company to have different brands, products or services, information for investors, a corporate blog, affiliates, branches in different countries, etc. If all these contents appear as independent additional web domains (AWDs), the company should be represented on the web by all these web domains, since many of these AWDs may acquire remarkable performance that could mask or distort the real web performance of the company, affecting therefore on the understanding of web metrics. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach – The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings – The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications – The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value – Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel system which can transform a recipe into any selected regional style (e.g., Japanese, Mediterranean, or Italian). This system has two characteristics. First the system can identify the degree of regional cuisine style mixture of any selected recipe and visualize such regional cuisine style mixtures using barycentric Newton diagrams. Second, the system can suggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe becomes more authentic for any selected regional cuisine style. Drawing on a large number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system can transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.},

However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72\%, along with an accuracy of 94.47\% on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson’s disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55\%, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson’s disease patients.},

The system can recognize food and estimate the calorific and nutrition content of foods automatically without any user intervention. To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate. Previous approaches have mostly worked with either images captured in a lab setting, or they require additional user input (eg, user crop bounding boxes). Our system achieves automatic food detection and recognition in real-life settings containing cluttered backgrounds. When multiple food items appear in an image, our system can identify them and estimate their portion size simultaneously. We implemented this system as both an Android smartphone application and as a web service. In our experiments, we have achieved above 85\% accuracy when detecting 15 different kinds of foods.},

	abstract = {Background Inferring a gene regulatory network from time-series gene expression data in systems biology is a challenging problem. Many methods have been suggested, most of which have a scalability limitation due to the combinatorial cost of searching a regulatory set of genes. In addition, they have focused on the accurate inference of a network structure only. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a network inference method to search regulatory genes efficiently and to predict the network dynamics accurately. Results In this study, we employed a Boolean network model with a restricted update rule scheme to capture coarse-grained dynamics, and propose a novel mutual information-based Boolean network inference (MIBNI) method. Given time-series gene expression data as an input, the method first identifies a set of initial regulatory genes using mutual information-based feature selection, and then improves the dynamics prediction accuracy by iteratively swapping a pair of genes between sets of the selected regulatory genes and the other genes. Through extensive simulations with artificial datasets, MIBNI showed consistently better performance than six well-known existing methods, REVEAL, Best-Fit, RelNet, CST, CLR, and BIBN in terms of both structural and dynamics prediction accuracy. We further tested the proposed method with two real gene expression datasets for an Escherichia coli gene regulatory network and a fission yeast cell cycle network, and also observed better results using MIBNI compared to the six other methods. Conclusions Taken together, MIBNI is a promising tool for predicting both the structure and the dynamics of a gene regulatory network.},

Although tables often describe multivariate data without explicit network semantics, it may be advantageous to explore the data modeled as a graph or network for analysis. Even when a given table design conveys some static network semantics, analysts may want to look at multiple networks from different perspectives, at different levels of abstraction, and with different edge semantics. We present a system called Ploceus that offers a general approach for performing multi-dimensional and multi-level network-based visual analysis on multivariate tabular data. Powered by an underlying relational algebraic framework, Ploceus supports flexible construction and transformation of networks through a direct manipulation interface, and integrates dynamic network manipulation with visual exploration for a seamless analytic experience.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction.

	abstract = {Background. Next Generation Sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have brought a revolution to the bioinformatics landscape, by offering sheer amounts of data about previously unaccessible domains in a cheap and scalable way. However, fast, reproducible, and cost-effective data analysis at such scale remains elusive. A key need for achieving it is being able to access and query the vast amount of publicly available data, specially so in the case of knowledge-intensive, semantically rich data: incredibly valuable information about proteins and their functions, genes, pathways, or all sort of biological knowledge encoded in ontologies remains scattered, semantically and physically fragmented. Methods and Results. Guided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph models. We have modeled and integrated most publicly available data linked with proteins into a set of interdependent graphs. Data querying is possible through a data model aware Domain Specific Language implemented in Java, letting the user write typed graph traversals over the integrated data. A ready to use cloud-based data distribution, based on the Titan graph database engine is provided; generic data import code can also be used for in-house deployment. Conclusion. Bio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for several key problems: data integration; expressive, high performance data access; and a cost-effective scalable cloud deployment model.},

	abstract = {Understanding how congestion at one location can cause ripples throughout large-scale transportation network is vital for transportation researchers and practitioners to pinpoint traffic bottlenecks for congestion mitigation. Traditional studies rely on either mathematical equations or simulation techniques to model traffic congestion dynamics. However, most of the approaches have limitations, largely due to unrealistic assumptions and cumbersome parameter calibration process. With the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Internet of Things (IoT), transportation data become more and more ubiquitous. This triggers a series of data-driven research to investigate transportation phenomena. Among them, deep learning theory is considered one of the most promising techniques to tackle tremendous high-dimensional data. This study attempts to extend deep learning theory into large-scale transportation network analysis. A deep Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Recurrent Neural Network architecture is utilized to model and predict traffic congestion evolution based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data from taxi. A numerical study in Ningbo, China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the prediction accuracy can achieve as high as 88\% within less than 6 minutes when the model is implemented in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel computing environment. The predicted congestion evolution patterns can be visualized temporally and spatially through a map-based platform to identify the vulnerable links for proactive congestion mitigation.},

Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these “brain hubs” is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called “rich club,” characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

	abstract = {Standard crossover in genetic programming (GP) selects two parents independently, based on fitness, and swaps randomly chosen portions of genetic material (subtrees). The mechanism by which the crossover operator achieves success in GP, and even whether crossover does in fact exhibit relative success compared to other operators such as mutation, is anything but clear [14]. An intuitive explanation for successful crossover would be that the operator produces fit offspring by combining the ?strengths? of each parent. However, standard selection schemes choose each parent independently of the other, and with regard to overall fitness rather than more specific phenotypic traits. We present an algorithm for choosing parents which have complementary performance on a set of fitness cases, with an eye toward enabling the crossover operator to produce offspring which combine the distinct strengths of each parent. We test Complementary Phenotype Selection in three genetic programming domains: Boolean 6-Multiplexer, Intertwined Spirals Classification, and Sunspot Prediction. We demonstrate significant performance gains over the control methods in all of them and present an analysis of these results.},

A client using SOAP can send or receive objects, or access remote object methods. Unlike other remote procedure call methods, like XML-RPC or RMI, SOAP can use many different transport types (for instance, it could be called as a CGI or as sockets). In this paper an approach to evolutionary distributed optimization of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) using SOAP and language Perl has been done. Obtained results show that the parallel version of the developed programs obtain similar or better results using much less time than the sequential version, obtaining a good speedup. Also can be shown that obtained results are better than those obtained by other authors using different methods.},

XSLT is a general purpose, document-oriented functional language, generally used to transform XML documents (or, in general, solve any problem that can be coded as an XML document). Previously, a solution that solved the problem efficiently was proposed. In this paper, we improve on those results by testing different fitness functions, adding a new operator and changing the type of desired output document that can be obtained. The experiments show that the best results are obtained without considering the XSLT length and including this new operator.},

	abstract = {Mating disruption is an agricultural technique that intends to substitute the use of insecticides for pest control. This technique consists of the diffusion of large amounts of sexual pheromone, so that the males are confused and mating is disrupted. Pheromones are released using devices called dispensers. The speed of release is, generally, a function of time and atmospheric conditions such as temperature and humidity. One of the objectives in the design of the dispensers is to minimise the effect of atmospheric conditions in the performance of the dispenser. With this objective, the Centro de Ecologia Quimica Agricola (CEQA) has designed an experimental dispenser that aims to compete with the dispensers already in the market. The hypothesis we want to validate (and which is based on experimental results) is that the performance of the CEQA dispenser is independent of the atmospheric conditions, as opposed to the most widely used commercial dispenser, Isomate CPlus. This was done using a genetic programming (GP) algorithm. GP evolved functions able to describe the performance of both dispensers and that support the initial hypothesis.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for modeling the arrival dates in time-stamped data sequences such as newscasts, e-mails, IRC conversations, scientific journal articles or weblog postings. These models are applied to the detection of buzz (i.e. terms that occur with a higher-than-normal frequency) in them, which has attracted a lot of interest in the online world with the increasing number of periodic content producers. That is why in this paper we have used this kind of online sequences to test our system, though it is also valid for other types of event sequences. The algorithm assigns frequencies (number of events per time unit) to time intervals so that it produces an optimal fit to the data. The optimization procedure is a trade off between accurately fitting the data and avoiding too many frequency changes, thus overcoming the noise inherent in these sequences. This process has been traditionally performed using dynamic programming algorithms, which are limited by memory and efficiency requirements. This limitation can be a problem when dealing with long sequences, and suggests the application of alternative search methods with some degree of uncertainty to achieve tractability, such as the evolutionary algorithm proposed in this paper. This algorithm is able to reach the same solution quality as those classical dynamic programming algorithms, but in a shorter time. We also test different cost functions and propose a new one that yields better fits than the one originally proposed by Kleinberg on real-world data. Finally, several distributions of states for the finite state automata are tested, with the result that an uniform distribution produces much better fits than the geometric distribution also proposed by Kleinberg. We also present a variant of the evolutionary algorithm, which achieves a fast fit of a sequence extended with new data, by taking advantage of the fit obtained for the original subsequence.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are readily available bioinformatics methods for clustering and visualizing high-dimensional data, provided that such biological information is previously transformed to fixed-size, metric-based vectors. To increase the usefulness of SOM-based approaches for the analysis of genomic sequence data, novel representation methods are required that automatically and bijectively transform aligned nucleotide sequences into numeric vectors, dealing with both nucleotide ambiguity and gaps derived from sequence alignment.Results: Six different codification variants based on Euclidean space, just like SOM processing, have been tested using two SOM models: the classical Kohonen’s SOM and growing cell structures. They have been applied to two different sets of sequences: 32 sequences of small sub-unit ribosomal RNA from organisms belonging to the three domains of life, and 44 sequences of the reverse transcriptase region of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 belonging to different groups and sub-types. Our results show that the most important factor affecting the accuracy of sequence clustering is the assignment of an extra weight to the presence of alignment-derived gaps. Although each of the codification variants shows a different level of taxonomic consistency, the results are in agreement with sequence-based phylogenetic reconstructions and anticipate a broad applicability of this codification method.Contact: sole@eui.upm.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Using evolutionary algorithms, we intend to optimize a modular fuzzy agent designed to determine the optimal target speed as well as the steering angle during the race. The challenge in this kind of fuzzy systems is the design of the membership functions, which is usually done through a trial and error process, but in this paper an adapted real-coded Genetic Algorithm with two different fitness functions - has been applied to find the best values for these parameters, obtaining a robust design for the TORCS controller. The evolved drivers were tested and evaluated competing against other TORCS controllers in practice mode, without rivals, and real races. The optimized fuzzy-controllers yield a very good performance, mainly in tracks that have many turning points, which are, in turn, the most difficult for any autonomous agent. Thus, this is a real enhancement of the baseline fuzzy controllers which had several difficulties to drive in this kind of circuits.},

	abstract = {Purpose – It is common for an international company to have different brands, products or services, information for investors, a corporate blog, affiliates, branches in different countries, etc. If all these contents appear as independent additional web domains (AWDs), the company should be represented on the web by all these web domains, since many of these AWDs may acquire remarkable performance that could mask or distort the real web performance of the company, affecting therefore on the understanding of web metrics. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach – The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings – The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications – The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value – Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful. This research measures the AWDs influence on companies under webometric terms for the first time.},

However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72\%, along with an accuracy of 94.47\% on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson’s disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55\%, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson’s disease patients.},

To identify food items, the user simply snaps a photo of the food plate. The system detects the salient region, crops its image, and subtracts the background accordingly. Hierarchical segmentation is performed to segment the image into regions. We then extract features at different locations and scales and classify these regions into different kinds of foods using a linear support vector machine classifier. In addition, the system determines the portion size which is then used to estimate the calorific and nutrition content of the food present on the plate. Previous approaches have mostly worked with either images captured in a lab setting, or they require additional user input (eg, user crop bounding boxes). Our system achieves automatic food detection and recognition in real-life settings containing cluttered backgrounds. When multiple food items appear in an image, our system can identify them and estimate their portion size simultaneously. We implemented this system as both an Android smartphone application and as a web service. In our experiments, we have achieved above 85\% accuracy when detecting 15 different kinds of foods.},

	abstract = {Background Inferring a gene regulatory network from time-series gene expression data in systems biology is a challenging problem. Many methods have been suggested, most of which have a scalability limitation due to the combinatorial cost of searching a regulatory set of genes. In addition, they have focused on the accurate inference of a network structure only. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a network inference method to search regulatory genes efficiently and to predict the network dynamics accurately. Results In this study, we employed a Boolean network model with a restricted update rule scheme to capture coarse-grained dynamics, and propose a novel mutual information-based Boolean network inference (MIBNI) method. Given time-series gene expression data as an input, the method first identifies a set of initial regulatory genes using mutual information-based feature selection, and then improves the dynamics prediction accuracy by iteratively swapping a pair of genes between sets of the selected regulatory genes and the other genes. Through extensive simulations with artificial datasets, MIBNI showed consistently better performance than six well-known existing methods, REVEAL, Best-Fit, RelNet, CST, CLR, and BIBN in terms of both structural and dynamics prediction accuracy. We further tested the proposed method with two real gene expression datasets for an Escherichia coli gene regulatory network and a fission yeast cell cycle network, and also observed better results using MIBNI compared to the six other methods. Conclusions Taken together, MIBNI is a promising tool for predicting both the structure and the dynamics of a gene regulatory network.},

Stochastic generative models inspired different scenarios to explain the growth of interaction networks during evolution. The power law and the associated properties appeared so ubiquitous in complex networks that they were qualified as "universal laws". However, these properties are no longer observed when the data are subjected to statistical tests: in most cases, the data do not fit the expected theoretical models, and the cases of good fitting merely result from sampling artefacts or improper data representation. The field of network biology seems to be founded on a series of myths, i.e. widely believed but false ideas. The weaknesses of these foundations should however not be considered as a failure for the entire domain. Network analysis provides a powerful frame for understanding the function and evolution of biological processes, provided it is brought to an appropriate level of description, by focussing on smaller functional modules and establishing the link between their topological properties and their dynamical behaviour.},

	abstract = {Link prediction for knowledge graphs is the task of predicting missing
relationships between entities. Previous work on link prediction has focused on
shallow, fast models which can scale to large knowledge graphs. However, these
models learn less expressive features than deep, multi-layer models -- which
potentially limits performance. In this work, we introduce ConvE, a multi-layer
convolutional network model for link prediction, and report state-of-the-art
results for several established datasets. We also show that the model is highly
parameter efficient, yielding the same performance as DistMult and R-GCN with
8x and 17x fewer parameters. Analysis of our model suggests that it is
particularly effective at modelling nodes with high indegree -- which are
common in highly-connected, complex knowledge graphs such as Freebase and
YAGO3. In addition, it has been noted that the WN18 and FB15k datasets suffer
from test set leakage, due to inverse relations from the training set being
present in the test set -- however, the extent of this issue has so far not
been quantified. We find this problem to be severe: a simple rule-based model
can achieve state-of-the-art results on both WN18 and FB15k. To ensure that
models are evaluated on datasets where simply exploiting inverse relations
cannot yield competitive results, we investigate and validate several commonly
used datasets -- deriving robust variants where necessary. We then perform
experiments on these robust datasets for our own and several previously
proposed models and find that ConvE achieves state-of-the-art Mean Reciprocal
Rank across most datasets.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

The explosive advances in the many numerical methods available for detecting, discriminating, and ultimately testing, SOC have played a critical role in developing our understanding of how systems experience and exhibit SOC. In this article, methods of detecting SOC are reviewed; from correlations to complexity to critical quantities. A description of the basic autocorrelation method leads into a detailed analysis of application-oriented methods developed in the last 25 years. In the second half of this manuscript space-based, time-based and spatial-temporal methods are reviewed and the prevalence of power laws in nature is described, with an emphasis on event detection and characterization. The search for numerical methods to clearly and unambiguously detect SOC in data often leads us outside the comfort zone of our own disciplines—the answers to these questions are often obtained by studying the advances made in other fields of study. In addition, numerical detection methods often provide the optimum link between simulations and experiments in scientific research. We seek to explore this boundary where the rubber meets the road, to review this expanding field of research of numerical detection of SOC systems over the past 25 years, and to iterate forwards so as to provide some foresight and guidance into developing breakthroughs in this subject over the next quarter of a century.},

Exemplary applications include the reconstruction of social ties from data on human interactions, the inference of gene co-expression networks from DNA microarray data, or the learning of semantic relationships based on co-occurrences of words in documents. Solving these problems requires techniques to infer significant links in noisy relational data. In this short paper, we propose a new statistical modeling framework to address this challenge. The framework builds on generalized hypergeometric ensembles, a class of generative stochastic models that give rise to analytically tractable probability spaces of directed, multi-edge graphs. We show how this framework can be used to assess the significance of links in noisy relational data. We illustrate our method in two data sets capturing spatio-temporal proximity relations between actors in a social system. The results show that our analytical framework provides a new approach to infer significant links from relational data, with interesting perspectives for the mining of data on social systems.},

Relational Covariate Adjustment is implemented through two high-level operations: identification of an adjustment set and relational regression adjustment. The former is achieved through an extension of Pearl's back-door criterion to relational domains. We demonstrate how this extended definition can be used to estimate causal effects in the presence of network interference and confounding. RCA is agnostic to functional form, and it can easily model both discrete and continuous treatments as well as estimate the effects of a wider array of network interventions than existing experimental approaches. We show that RCA can yield robust estimates of causal effects using common regression models without extensive parameter tuning. Through a series of simulation experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world network structures, we show that causal effects estimated on observational data with RCA are nearly as accurate as those estimated from well-designed network experiments},

	abstract = {Network representations can help reveal the behavior of complex systems.
Useful information can be derived from the network properties and invariants,
such as components, clusters or cliques, as well as from their changes over
time. The evolution of clusters of nodes (or communities) is one of the major
focus of research. However, the time dimension increases complexity,
introducing new constructs and requiring novel and enhanced algorithms. In
spite of recent improvements, the relative scarcity of timestamped
representations of empiric networks, with known ground truth, hinders algorithm
validation. A few approaches have been proposed to generate synthetic temporal
networks that conform to static topological specifications while in general
adopting an ad-hoc approach to temporal evolution. We believe there is still a
need for a principled synthetic network generator that conforms to problem
domain topological specifications from a static as well as temporal
perspective. Here we present such a system. The unique attributes of our system
include accepting arbitrary node degree and cluster size distributions and
temporal evolution under user control, while supporting tunable joint
distribution and temporal correlation of node degrees. Theoretical
contributions include the analysis of conditions for "graphability" of
sequences of inter and intra cluster node degrees and cluster sizes and the
development of a heuristic to search for the cluster membership of nodes that
minimizes the shared information distance between clusterings. Our work shows
that this system is capable of generating networks under user controlled
topology with up to thousands of nodes and hundreds of clusters with strong
topology adherence. Much larger networks are possible with relaxed
requirements. The generated networks support algorithm validation as well as
problem domain analysis.},

In most cases, relationships between nodes are not directly observable and must be inferred: Does one gene regulate the expression of another? Do two animals who physically co-locate have a social bond? Who infected whom in a disease outbreak in a population? Existing approaches for inferring networks from data are found across many application domains and use specialized knowledge to infer and measure the quality of inferred network for a specific task or hypothesis. However, current research lacks a rigorous methodology that employs standard statistical validation on inferred models. In this survey, we examine (1) how network representations are constructed from underlying data, (2) the variety of questions and tasks on these representations over several domains, and (3) validation strategies for measuring the inferred network’s capability of answering questions on the system of interest.},

Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such “modularly varying goals” lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.},

In the first part, an overview on complex networks and network-based machine learning is presented, offering necessary background material. In the second part, we describe in details some specific techniques based on complex networks for supervised, non-supervised, and semi-supervised learning. Particularly, a stochastic particle competition technique for both non-supervised and semi-supervised learning using a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system is described in details. Moreover, an analytical analysis is supplied, which enables one to predict the behavior of the proposed technique. In addition, data reliability issues are explored in semi-supervised learning. Such matter has practical importance and is not often found in the literature. With the goal of validating these techniques for solving real problems, simulations on broadly accepted databases are conducted. Still in this book, we present a hybrid supervised classification technique that combines both low and high orders of learning. The low level term can be implemented by any classification technique, while the high level term is realized by the extraction of features of the underlying network constructed from the input data. Thus, the former classifies the test instances by their physical features, while the latter measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the data. We show that the high level technique can realize classification according to the semantic meaning of the data. This book intends to combine two widely studied research areas, machine learning and complex networks, which in turn will generate broad interests to scientific community, mainly to computer science and engineering areas.},

It is divided into two parts consisting of twelve chapters dedicated to the development of theoretic tools for the structural analysis of networks, and seven chapters illustrating, in a critical way, applications of these tools to real-world scenarios. The first chapters provide detailed coverage of adjacency, metric, and topological properties of networks, followed by chapters devoted to the analysis of fragment-based and global invariants in complex networks. Then, there are chapters that analyse the concepts of communicability, centrality, bipartivity, expansibility, and communities in networks, as well as the study of random networks of different types. The second part of the book starts with an analysis of the study of gene regulation and transcription networks, followed by a chapter dedicated to the study of protein residue networks and another on protein–protein interaction networks. Then, the study of reaction networks is critically presented in three main sections devoted to man-made organic reactions, the chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres, and metabolic networks. This part of the book continues with the study of anatomical networks, which include intercellular, vascular, and brain networks. Another chapter studies the use of complex networks in ecological scenarios by examining not only food webs, but also mutualistic webs and landscape networks. The final chapter of the book is devoted to the study of both social and economic networks.},

These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also discuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.},

We examined this issue using digital organisms—computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Populations of digital organisms often evolved the ability to perform complex logic functions requiring the coordinated execution of many genomic instructions. Complex functions evolved by building on simpler functions that had evolved earlier, provided that these were also selectively favoured. However, no particular intermediate stage was essential for evolving complex functions. The first genotypes able to perform complex functions differed from their non-performing parents by only one or two mutations, but differed from the ancestor by many mutations that were also crucial to the new functions. In some cases, mutations that were deleterious when they appeared served as stepping-stones in the evolution of complex features. These findings show how complex functions can originate by random mutation and natural selection.},

The essence of the similarity here is that network features of the same network type are highly similar, while the features of different kinds of networks present low similarity. In this paper, we introduce and explore a new method for comparing various complex networks based on the cut distance. We show correspondence between the cut distance and the similarity of two networks. This correspondence allows us to consider a broad range of complex networks and explicitly compare various networks with high accuracy. Various machine learning technologies such as genetic algorithms, nearest neighbor classification, and model selection are employed during the comparison process. Our cut method is shown to be suited for comparisons of undirected networks and directed networks, as well as weighted networks. In the model selection process, the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with respect to accuracy.},

	abstract = {How do real graphs evolve over time? What are normal growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study. We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point. Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.},

It includes general considerations about complex network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the presentation of the main existing measurements. Important related issues covered in this work comprise the representation of the evolution of complex networks in terms of trajectories in several measurement spaces, the analysis of the correlations between some of the most traditional measurements, perturbation analysis, as well as the use of multivariate statistics for feature selection and network classification. Depending on the network and the analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen.

	abstract = {No man is an island, as individuals interact and influence one another daily in our society. When social influence takes place in experiments on a population of interconnected individuals, the treatment on a unit may affect the outcomes of other units, a phenomenon known as interference. This thesis develops a causal framework and inference methodology for experiments where interference takes place on a network of influence (i.e. network interference). In this framework, the network potential outcomes serve as the key quantity and flexible building blocks for causal estimands that represent a variety of primary, peer, and total treatment effects. These causal estimands are estimated via principled Bayesian imputation of missing outcomes. The theory on the unconfoundedness assumptions leading to simplified imputation highlights the importance of including relevant network covariates in the potential outcome model. Additionally, experimental designs that result in balanced covariates and sizes across treatment exposure groups further improve the causal estimate, especially by mitigating potential outcome model mis-specification. The true potential outcome model is not typically known in real-world experiments, so the best practice is to account for interference and confounding network covariates through both balanced designs and model-based imputation. A full factorial simulated experiment is formulated to demonstrate this principle by comparing performance across different randomization schemes during the design phase and estimators during the analysis phase, under varying network topology and true potential outcome models. Overall, this thesis asserts that interference is not just a nuisance for analysis but rather an opportunity for quantifying and leveraging peer effects in real-world experiments.},
